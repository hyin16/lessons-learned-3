The cost to hire a salaried employee for the development and upkeep of an application far outweighs the benefits of an application in most cases.  Even with contracted employees, the application will drain significant capital resources, especially since this would require development of two similar apps (iOS and Android).  In most cases, webpages are able to complete the same functionality for a fraction of the setup costs. The only reason that somebody should create an app before being a millionaire are features that are not able to be met through mobile webpages, such as the need for location based services or push notifications. :horse:  <-- is the emoji supposed to be relevant, or is it just for fun?
